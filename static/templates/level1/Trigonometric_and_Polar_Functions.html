      <h2>Trigonometric and Inverse Trigonometric Functions</h2>
      <br>
    
      <p>
        Trigonometric functions are fundamental in modeling periodic behaviors, such as waves, rotations, and oscillations. These functions are used extensively in physics, engineering, and computer science. Their inverses, on the other hand, are used to find angles when given ratios, enabling the solution of a wide variety of geometric and trigonometric problems.
      </p>
      <br>
    
      <h3>1. The Sine Function: \( \sin(x) \)</h3>
      <br>
    
      <p>
        The sine function models periodic behavior, oscillating between -1 and 1. It is one of the most commonly used trigonometric functions and plays a key role in wave phenomena such as sound waves, light waves, and alternating currents.
      </p>
      <br>
    
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Periodicity:</strong> \( \sin(x) \) has a period of \( 2\pi \), meaning it repeats every \( 2\pi \) units along the x-axis.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Amplitude:</strong> The sine function has an amplitude of 1, meaning its values oscillate between -1 and 1.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Applications:</strong> Used in modeling oscillations, sound waves, and simple harmonic motion.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
    
      <h3>2. The Cosine Function: \( \cos(x) \)</h3>
      <br>
    
      <p>
        The cosine function is similar to the sine function, but it has a different phase shift. It is often used to model similar periodic behaviors, but it is offset from the sine function by a phase of \( \frac{\pi}{2} \).
      </p>
      <br>
    
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Periodicity:</strong> Like the sine function, \( \cos(x) \) also has a period of \( 2\pi \).</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Amplitude:</strong> \( \cos(x) \) has an amplitude of 1, oscillating between -1 and 1.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Applications:</strong> Cosine is frequently used in physics to model waveforms, alternating current, and circular motion.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
    
      <h3>3. The Tangent Function: \( \tan(x) \)</h3>
      <br>
    
      <p>
        The tangent function is the ratio of sine to cosine, i.e., \( \tan(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)} \). Unlike sine and cosine, the tangent function has vertical asymptotes where the cosine function equals zero, which occurs at \( x = \frac{\pi}{2} + n\pi \), where \( n \) is an integer.
      </p>
      <br>
    
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Asymptotes:</strong> \( \tan(x) \) has vertical asymptotes where \( \cos(x) = 0 \), or at \( x = \frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{3\pi}{2}, \dots \)</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Periodicity:</strong> The period of \( \tan(x) \) is \( \pi \), meaning it repeats every \( \pi \) units along the x-axis.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Applications:</strong> The tangent function is used in modeling angular velocity, slopes of curves, and in the calculation of certain angles in trigonometry.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
    
      <h3>4. Inverse Trigonometric Functions</h3>
      <br>
    
      <p>
        The inverse trigonometric functions are used to find angles when the values of the trigonometric ratios are known. These functions are essential for solving trigonometric equations and are used in many real-world applications.
      </p>
      <br>
    
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Inverse sine:</strong> \( \sin^{-1}(x) \) or \( \arcsin(x) \) gives the angle whose sine is \( x \), with the range \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{2} \).</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Inverse cosine:</strong> \( \cos^{-1}(x) \) or \( \arccos(x) \) gives the angle whose cosine is \( x \), with the range \( 0 \leq \theta \leq \pi \).</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Inverse tangent:</strong> \( \tan^{-1}(x) \) or \( \arctan(x) \) gives the angle whose tangent is \( x \), with the range \( -\frac{\pi}{2} < \theta < \frac{\pi}{2} \).</li>
      </ul>
      <br>

      <p>
        Trigonometric functions, along with their inverses, are widely used in various fields, including:

    <div class="panel">
      <h2>Derivatives of Trigonometric Functions</h2>
      <br>
    
      <p>
        Trigonometric functions have unique and elegant derivatives that are cyclical, reflecting the periodic nature of these functions. Understanding these derivatives is crucial in solving problems in various fields such as physics, engineering, and calculus, particularly in the study of motion, waves, and rotations.
      </p>
      <br>
    
      <h3>1. The Derivative of Sine: \( \sin(x) \)</h3>
      <br>
    
      <p>
        The derivative of the sine function is the cosine function, which represents the rate of change of the sine wave. This relationship is fundamental in the study of oscillations and waveforms.
      </p>
      <br>
    
      <p style="text-align: center;">
        \( \frac{d}{dx}[\sin(x)] = \cos(x) \)
      </p>
      <br>
    
      <p>
        This means that at any point on the sine curve, the rate of change (or slope) of the sine wave is given by the value of the cosine function at that point. This property is used in various applications like harmonic motion and alternating current analysis.
      </p>
      <br>
    
      <h3>2. The Derivative of Cosine: \( \cos(x) \)</h3>
      <br>
    
      <p>
        The derivative of the cosine function is the negative sine function, reflecting the symmetry of the sine and cosine waves. This relationship plays a key role in describing rotations and angular velocity.
      </p>
      <br>
    
      <p style="text-align: center;">
        \( \frac{d}{dx}[\cos(x)] = -\sin(x) \)
      </p>
      <br>
    
      <p>
        Since cosine is a phase-shifted version of sine, its derivative involves a negative sign. This is used extensively in physics, particularly in rotational dynamics and wave theory.
      </p>
      <br>
    
      <h3>3. The Derivative of Tangent: \( \tan(x) \)</h3>
      <br>
    
      <p>
        The derivative of the tangent function is the secant squared function. This result is crucial for analyzing rates of change in problems involving slopes and angular acceleration.
      </p>
      <br>
    
      <p style="text-align: center;">
        \( \frac{d}{dx}[\tan(x)] = \sec^2(x) \)
      </p>
      <br>
    
      <p>
        Since \( \sec(x) = \frac{1}{\cos(x)} \), the secant function amplifies the rate of change of tangent as \( \cos(x) \) approaches zero, leading to vertical asymptotes at odd multiples of \( \frac{\pi}{2} \). This is important in various engineering fields, such as signal processing.
      </p>
      <br>
    
      <h3>4. The Derivative of Secant: \( \sec(x) \)</h3>
      <br>
    
      <p>
        The derivative of the secant function involves both secant and tangent. This result is key when working with inverse trigonometric functions and integrals in calculus.
      </p>
      <br>
    
      <p style="text-align: center;">
        \( \frac{d}{dx}[\sec(x)] = \sec(x)\tan(x) \)
      </p>
      <br>
    
      <p>
        This derivative describes the rate of change of the secant function as the angle increases. It is commonly used in physics, particularly in the study of forces acting along curves or in circular motion.
      </p>
      <br>
    
      <h3>5. The Derivative of Cosecant: \( \csc(x) \)</h3>
      <br>
    
      <p>
        The derivative of the cosecant function involves both cosecant and cotangent. This derivative arises in problems involving angles of elevation and depression, where the rate of change of the cosecant function is essential.
      </p>
      <br>
    
      <p style="text-align: center;">
        \( \frac{d}{dx}[\csc(x)] = -\csc(x)\cot(x) \)
      </p>
      <br>
    
      <p>
        The negative sign indicates that the cosecant function decreases as \( x \) increases, which is important in problems involving decay or decreasing forces.
      </p>
      <br>
    
      <h3>6. The Derivative of Cotangent: \( \cot(x) \)</h3>
      <br>
    
      <p>
        The derivative of the cotangent function is the negative cosecant squared function. This result is useful in problems involving angular velocity, rotations, and harmonic motion.
      </p>
      <br>
    
      <p style="text-align: center;">
        \( \frac{d}{dx}[\cot(x)] = -\csc^2(x) \)
      </p>
      <br>
    
      <p>
        Just like the secant and tangent functions, the cosecant and cotangent functions are related in terms of their rates of change. These derivatives help us understand oscillations and waveforms in many engineering applications.
      </p>
      <br>
    
      <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
      <br>
    
      <ul style="padding-left: 20px;">

      <h2>Chain Rule and U-Substitution with Trigonometric Functions</h2>
      <br>
    
      <p>
        When trigonometric functions are composed with other functions, such as in \( \sin(g(x)) \) or \( \tan(5x^2) \), we apply the <strong>chain rule</strong> for differentiation. This rule allows us to differentiate composite functions efficiently by differentiating the outer function and then multiplying by the derivative of the inner function.
      </p>
      <br>
    
      <h3>1. The Chain Rule for Trigonometric Functions</h3>
      <br>
    
      <p>
        The chain rule states that if we have a composite function, say \( f(x) = \sin(g(x)) \), the derivative of this function is given by the product of the derivative of the outer function \( \sin(x) \) evaluated at \( g(x) \) and the derivative of the inner function \( g(x) \).
      </p>
      <br>
    
      <ul style="padding-left: 20px;">
        <li><strong>Derivative of \( \sin(g(x)) \):</strong> 
          \[
          \frac{d}{dx}[\sin(g(x))] = \cos(g(x)) \cdot g'(x)
          \]
          This shows that the rate of change of \( \sin(g(x)) \) depends on both the rate of change of \( g(x) \) and the value of \( \cos(g(x)) \).
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Example for Tangent:</strong> 
          \[
          \frac{d}{dx}[\tan(5x^2)] = \sec^2(5x^2) \cdot 10x
          \]
          Here, we apply the chain rule to \( \tan(5x^2) \). The derivative of the outer function \( \tan(u) \) is \( \sec^2(u) \), and then we multiply by the derivative of the inner function \( 5x^2 \), which is \( 10x \).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
    
      <h3>2. U-Substitution in Integration</h3>
      <br>
    
      <p>
        In integration, the reverse process of the chain rule is called <strong>u-substitution</strong>. This technique allows us to simplify integrals involving composite functions, making them easier to solve. The goal is to identify a portion of the integrand that can be substituted with a new variable \( u \), simplifying the integral.
      </p>
      <br>
    
      <p>
        For example, consider the integral:
      </p>
      <br>
    
      <p style="text-align: center;">
        \( \int \cos(3x)\,dx \)
      </p>
      <br>
    
      <p>
        Step 1: Identify the inner function, which is \( 3x \), and set \( u = 3x \). Therefore, \( du = 3dx \), or equivalently, \( dx = \frac{du}{3} \).
      </p>
      <br>
    
      <p>
        Step 2: Substitute \( u = 3x \) and \( dx = \frac{du}{3} \) into the integral:
      </p>
      <br>
    
      <p style="text-align: center;">
        \( \int \cos(3x)\,dx = \int \cos(u) \cdot \frac{du}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \int \cos(u)\,du
      \)
      </p>
      <br>
    
      <p>

      <h2>Calculus with Polar Functions</h2>
      <br>
    
      <p>
        Polar coordinates provide an alternative to Cartesian coordinates for representing points in a plane. Instead of using \( x \) and \( y \) to describe a point, polar coordinates use a radius \( r \) and an angle \( \theta \). The radius \( r \) represents the distance from the origin, while \( \theta \) represents the angle formed with the positive x-axis. Polar coordinates are particularly useful for modeling circular and rotational symmetry.
      </p>
      <br>
    
      <h3>1. Polar Coordinates</h3>
      <br>
    
      <p>
        A point in polar coordinates is represented as \( (r, \theta) \), where:
      </p>
      <br>
    
      <ul style="padding-left: 20px;">
        <li><strong>Radius \( r \):</strong> The distance from the origin to the point. If \( r \) is positive, the point lies on the ray at angle \( \theta \); if \( r \) is negative, the point lies in the opposite direction.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Angle \( \theta \):</strong> The angle made with the positive x-axis, measured counterclockwise. The angle can be in radians or degrees.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
    
      <p>
        Polar coordinates are often converted to Cartesian coordinates using the following formulas:
      </p>
      <br>
    
      \[
      x = r \cos(\theta)
      \]
      \[
      y = r \sin(\theta)
      \]
      <br>
    
      Conversely, Cartesian coordinates can be converted to polar coordinates using:
      <br>
    
      \[
      r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
      \]
      \[
      \theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)
      \]
      <br>
    
      <h3>2. Polar Functions</h3>
      <br>
    
      <p>
        A polar function is expressed as \( r = f(\theta) \), where \( r \) is the radial distance and \( \theta \) is the angle. These functions describe curves in the plane, where the shape of the curve is determined by how the radius \( r \) changes as the angle \( \theta \) varies.
      </p>
      <br>
    
      <p>
        Examples of common polar functions:
      </p>
      <br>
    
      <ul style="padding-left: 20px;">
        <li><strong>Circle:</strong> A circle centered at the origin with radius \( a \) is described by the polar function \( r = a \). The radius is constant, and the point moves in a perfect circle as \( \theta \) varies from \( 0 \) to \( 2\pi \).</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Spiral:</strong> A spiral can be described by a polar function such as \( r = a\theta \), where the radius increases as the angle increases, creating an outward spiral pattern.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Rose Curve:</strong> A rose curve is described by a function such as \( r = a \cos(k\theta) \) or \( r = a \sin(k\theta) \), where \( k \) determines the number of petals in the rose. These curves have a distinctive petal-like shape.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
    
      <h3>3. Calculus with Polar Functions</h3>
      <br>
    
      <p>
        In calculus, polar functions require specialized techniques to compute areas, tangents, and other quantities. The most common operations include:
      </p>
      <br>
    
      <ul style="padding-left: 20px;">
        <li><strong>Area Enclosed by a Polar Curve:</strong> The area enclosed by a polar curve \( r = f(\theta) \) from \( \theta = a \) to \( \theta = b \) is given by:
          \[
          A = \frac{1}{2} \int_a^b [f(\theta)]^2 \, d\theta
          \]
          This formula is derived from summing up infinitesimal sectors of the curve and is used to compute areas in problems involving rotational symmetry.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Slope of the Tangent Line:</strong> The slope of the tangent line to a polar curve at any given point is given by the formula:
          \[
          \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{r'(\theta)\sin(\theta) + r(\theta)\cos(\theta)}{r'(\theta)\cos(\theta) - r(\theta)\sin(\theta)}
          \]
          This formula helps us determine the direction of the curve at any given point, which is important in problems involving motion along a curve.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
    
      <h3>4. Example: Area of a Circle in Polar Coordinates</h3>
      <br>
    
      <p>
        Consider a circle with radius \( r = 3 \). The equation of the circle in polar coordinates is simply \( r = 3 \). To find the area enclosed by the circle, we use the area formula for polar curves:
      </p>
      <br>
    
      \[
      A = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^{2\pi} [3]^2 \, d\theta
      \]
      <br>
    
      \p>
        Step 1: Substitute \( r = 3 \) into the equation:
        \[
        A = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^{2\pi} 9 \, d\theta
        \]
      </p>
      <br>
    
      <p>
        Step 2: Integrate with respect to \( \theta \):
        \[
        A = \frac{1}{2} \times 9 \times \left( \theta \Big|_0^{2\pi} \right)
        \]
      </p>
      <br>
    
      <p>
        Step 3: Evaluate the integral:
        \[
        A = \frac{1}{2} \times 9 \times (2\pi - 0) = \frac{9}{2} \times 2\pi = 9\pi
        \]
      </p>
      <br>
    
      <p>
        So, the area enclosed by the circle is \( 9\pi \) square units.
      </p>
